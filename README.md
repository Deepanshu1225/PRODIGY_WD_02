# PRODIGY_WD_02
Build a to-do list application that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. The application should have a simple interface where users can add new tasks, mark completed tasks, and delete tasks. Use HTML to create the interface, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to handle user interactivity and saving the tasks to local storage.
